A regression model predicts player earnings and evaluates errors on a per-player basis to assess prediction fairness and model accuracy.

## 🧠 Key Features

- Linear regression-based earnings prediction
- Evaluation using MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Error analysis grouped by player
- Normalized error-to-earning ratio analysis
- Visual insights via histogram

## 🧪 Technologies

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

## 📈 Example Outputs

- Predictions appended to test data
- Histogram of prediction error ratio per player
- Ranked players by prediction error relative to their earnings
